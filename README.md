# Soccer-Bot
Robo soccer or Soccer bot is a very simple and beginner friendly project for learning robotics and basic control systems.

## Project Idea
The Robo-soccer bot is a controller controlled robot designed to play soccer. The main goal is to move towards the ball in the arena, control it and push it into the goal bar.

## Objectives
- Control the bot using a controller
- Move precisely towards the ball
- Control direction and speed of motors
- Score goals by pushing the ball into the goal post

## Components Used
- Microcontroller: Arduino Uno
- 37GB 12V 500 RPM gear motors
- BTS7960 Motor drivers 
- 2200mAh 3S LiPo battery
- HC-05 bluetooth module
- Chassis, 65mm wheel, L bracket, Hex nuts

## Working Principle
This bot is controlled manually by a controller. For simplicity, a controller app installed from google play store is used and connected via bluetooth. The bot is driven precisely towards the ball and then pushes it into the goal bar to score a goal. The motor speed is adjustable through Arduino code but maximum limit for the selected motor is 500 rpm.

## Challenges & Learnings
- Learned motor control and wiring of components 
- Faced challages in achieving accurate movement and control

## Future Improvements
- Improved defensive capabilities
- Improved speed and movement control
